\subsection{Start and end}
Since the device is intended for retired and/or ill people, starting and stopping the program is done as simple as possible. The user is prompted to start or abort the program. If the program is started, it runs until the EOF is reached. If the program is aborted, the program terminates.\\

Since this program finishes analyzing the test data within milliseconds, it has not been possible to abort during run-time. We would have preferred to implement a stop option, if the data was imported with a time delay (in real time).
