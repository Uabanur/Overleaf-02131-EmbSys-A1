In the DTU course \texttt{02131 Embedded Systems}, we pretend to be engineers at the fictive company \texttt{Medembed}. Our task is to investigate whether the Pan-Thompkins QRS detection algorithm can be used in a personal wearable ECG (\underline{e}lectro\underline{c}ardio\underline{g}ram) scanner. In this report, we document how we implemented the QRS algorithm in C, and determine whether the algorithm can be implemented reasonably in an embedded system.
